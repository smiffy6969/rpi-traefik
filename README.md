#ulsmith/rpi-traefik

Taken from the original traefik image, rejiggered for rpi on a pi2 (arm7).

Traefik is a reverse proxy with dynamic container sniffing, adding to the proxy and removing on container EXPOSE events. When a container is exposed to a single port, it will be added to traefik without the need to alter configs.

For information using this image, please refer to traefik docs here [https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik/].
